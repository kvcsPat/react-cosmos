# DISCOVER THE COSMOS

## Introduction

This app utilizes [NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api), an archive which features various images of the cosmos.
It allows viewing of not only the current image of the day, but navigation to view the archive of images dating all the way back to 1995.

The idea of the app is based on an old Codecool project, in which I learned to fetch data in vanillaJS using this API. I decided to create an extended version to deepen my knowledge in React.

## Future Improvements

I really enjoyed working on this project and facing its challenges so I would like to extend it further in the future.

Additional features I have in mind:

- tablet and mobile view
- light and dark mode
- gallery pagination
- registration and login
- save and share favorite APODs
